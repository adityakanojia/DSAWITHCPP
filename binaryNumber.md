# Binary Numbers Explained

## What is a Binary Number?

A **binary number** is a number expressed in the **base-2 numeral system** which uses only two symbols: typically `"0"` (zero) and `"1"` (one). Each digit is called a *bit*, short for binary digit.

### Example:
Binary number `101101` is calculated as:  
\[
(1 \times 2^5) + (0 \times 2^4) + (1 \times 2^3) + (1 \times 2^2) + (0 \times 2^1) + (1 \times 2^0)
\]

\[
= 32 + 0 + 8 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 45_{(decimal)}
\]

## Why Computers Use Binary Numbers?

1. **Simplicity**:  
   Computers operate using electrical signals which can be either **ON** or **OFF**. These two states naturally map to binary digits:
   - `0` → OFF
   - `1` → ON

2. **Logic Operations**:  
   Binary simplifies computer logic, as all arithmetic and logical operations can be efficiently performed with just two states, enhancing speed and reliability.

## How Computers Use Binary Numbers?

1. **Storing Information**:  
   All types of data, such as numbers, text, images, audio, and video, are stored as sequences of bits.

2. **Computation**:  
   Computers perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) using binary arithmetic.

3. **Communication**:  
   Binary signals transmit data within and between computer systems (CPU, memory, input/output devices).

## Summary
Binary numbers, consisting of only two digits (`0` and `1`), are foundational for digital systems. Their simplicity enables efficient and accurate storage, computation, and communication in computers.
